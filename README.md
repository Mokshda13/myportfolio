This is a test area to work on embeddings

The sequence of operation is to chopdocuments, embed documents, then create final data

the file get_most_similar is the method for retreival.  You will notice many similarity calcs. 
these are the similarity calcs we will use as measures to determine the best retrieval methods 

make sure you change the location of your data repository across all of these modules
  note: look for nltk.data.path.append line

you can run get_most_similar directly and see the retrieval startistics
